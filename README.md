# Predicting Product Performance on Leaderboard using Linear Regression (HNG Internship Forecasting Challenge)

> A product analytics and forecasting project built around real-time leaderboard scores from the HNG Internship.  
> Forecasts the **Top 5 Product Teams** by Friday based on weekly check-in data using **Linear Regression** and other time series methods.

##  Project Overview

This project tackles a real business scenario:  
**"Which product team is likely to top the leaderboard by the end of the week?"**

Using daily check-in scores from the HNG Internship program, I analyzed trends, built predictive models, and visualized expected performance by Friday.  
This type of product-focused forecasting is common in **growth, customer success, and performance analytics** roles.

We explored multiple methods, including:

- ðŸ“ˆ **Absolute Average Growth**
- ðŸ“‰ **Linear Regression** *(Chosen for best accuracy in this case)*
- ðŸ”„ **Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)**

The result? A **predictive system** that helps forecast team success before results are finalized.
